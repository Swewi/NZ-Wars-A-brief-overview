                        <p>
                            As Māori throughout New Zealand returned to their villages and cultivations in order to once
                            again secure themselves socially and, more critically, economically, the government embarked
                            upon its vigorous legislative programme to change the nature of Māori land holdings.
                        </p>

                            Māori land was to be changed from communal titles, to individual titles.
                            'One-person' ownership meant that land could be more readily sold, which was the
                            government's intention.
                            The change in title was made possible through legislation - the Native Lands Act 1862. This
                            Act started the long process of converting Māori customary from communal title to individual
                            title. Land could then be traded by Māori as if it were a commodity, or so the government
                            said.
                            This Act was amended in 1865, three years later, by introducing a Native Land Court which
                            would function for a century or more, earning the nickname 'engine of destruction'. Māori
                            generally resented the existence of the Court and tried hard to boycott its operations.

                        <h4>Land Confiscations</h4>
                        <p>
                            The government also moved to effect wholesale confiscations of land from Māori deemed to
                            have 'borne arms against the Crown'. Land was 'confiscated' by the government under the New
                            Zealand Settlements Act 1863 which enabled the Governor to declare lands to be forfeit by
                            Māori for having participated in the wars.
                            You can read the Act here - New Zealand Settlements Act 1867.
                            If you were Māori, and felt aggrieved at your losses, you could appear before a special
                            Compensation Court and argue your case for the return of your land. However, the
                            Compensation Court soon seen to be wholly inadequate for the task of dealing with Māori and
                            their lands fairly.

                <h3>Population Decline</h3>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            When Pākehā first arrived in New Zealand, the Māori population by some estimates stood at
                            about 90,000 people, spread all over Aotearoa though most lived near the coast. By the time
                            the war at Waitara began in 1860, the Māori population had fallen to about 60,000. The
                            population decline rapidly continued thereafter. In the post war period, from 1874 (the
                            first Māori census) to 1896 (the lowest point), the population fell by another 20,000, to a
                            lowest point of 39,000.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Clearly, the impacts of colonisation upon Māori were severe, as these figures show. But in
                            the post war period, when the opportunity arose for the government to rectify the Māori
                            decline and protect Māori communities, it did neither, instead embarking upon a vigorous and
                            punitive land acquisition programme that exacerbated this fall in population numbers.
                            After the wars were over, the Māori population went into a steep decline, raising fears
                            amongst Pākehā that 'the Māori race' might actually die out. This fear - or expectation -
                            dominated Pākehā thinking right up to the 1920s, and even beyond, influencing the way
                            histories of Māori and New Zealand were written.
                            On the basis of Census information, then, the Māori population figures were certainly in
                            decline. Many reasons were given for why this was occurring, many of them highly
                            questionable. The lowest year (Census) for Māori on record was 1896. Thereafter, according
                            to the population data, the Māori population began to increase, though this increase was not
                            noticed or believed by Pākehā at large for some years.
                            Māori and Pākehā population figures compared
                            1840 estimates range between 90,000 and 100,000 - Pākehā population was 2000
                            1859 Māori and Pākehā populations were now equal, at approximately 60,000 each
                            1874 Māori population had fallen to 45,470; Pākehā were now 295,946
                            1878 Māori decline continues to 43,595; Pākehā population rises to 432,519
                            1881 Māori population rises slightly to 44,097
                            1886 another decline however, to 41,969; the Pākehā figure for 1888 is 607,380
                            1891 a further decline to 41,993
                            1896 the lowest point for Māori, 39,663; Pākehā numbers in 1893 reached 672,265

                            In 1867, Māori were finally awarded the vote, 27 years after the signing of the Treaty of
                            Waitangi in 1840. It had taken that long for the Crown to grant Māori the right to
                            participate in New Zealand’s political process.
                            By the Māori Representation Act 1867, Māori were awarded four special seats in Parliament.
                            However, using the same population calculations that set the number of Pākehā seats, Māori
                            should have had at least fifteen seats.

                        <p>
                            Maori Seats Temporary
                            The Māori seats were also designed to be temporary, for two reasons. Firstly, the awarding
                            of the seats to Māori had come about largely through pressure exerted from the British
                            Parliament, where the question was being asked – why is it that Māori do not have the vote?
                            So, special seats were set up, but they were not meant to last for long, perhaps 5 years.
                            The second reason for setting the Māori seats as temporary was that, under the existing
                            electoral rules, everyone (ie Pākehā) belonged to a general roll. To qualify for that roll,
                            however, you needed to own a certain amount of land as an individual. Because Māori
                            customary ownership was communal (owned by the whole tribe), Māori did not qualify for the
                            general roll, and, therefore, did not have the vote.
                            Converting Māori Land
                            However, the government expected that to change, within at least 5 years. Legislation had
                            already been passed (Native Lands Act 1862, 1865) which set about converting Māori land
                            ownership from communal to individual. Māori strongly resisted this conversion because it
                            inevitably led to wholesale land losses. Within 5 years (it was thought) all Māori land
                            would be individually owned, thanks to the legislation. Māori would then qualify for the
                            general roll, and would not need their special seats anymore.
                            That was the plan, but it did not work out that way. Within five years, Māori land was still
                            overwhelmingly communal. So the seats temporary nature was extended. However, in the end,
                            the process of changing Māori titles would last a century or more, meaning that the
                            ‘temporary’ seats soon became permanent seats, lasting until 1991. In that year (1991), for
                            the first time, the same population calculations as applied to general seats was applied to
                            the Māori seats. This led to an increase in number from four to seven.
                            Abolishing the Māori Seats
                            Given how unfairly the Māori seats were first established (only 4 seats, and only temporary
                            while Māori lose their lands), it now seems remarkable that many Pākehā and most political
                            parties argue that the seats should be abolished, representing (it is claimed) evidence of
                            ‘special laws favoring Māori’.

                <h3>The Economy</h3>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The Pre-Contact Māori Economy
                            Prior to Pākehā arriving in New Zealand, the Māori economy was based upon local
                            cultivations, forests and the sea. Māori acquired generations of experience in growing,
                            gathering and hunting for food. Māori were also able to store crops over winter by building
                            special storehouses, like covered kumara pits where seed kumara were also stored for next
                            year’s planting.
                            The basic principle of this early economy, however, was subsistence – you consumed what you
                            planted. There was no surplus for trade or exchange; at least, not as a general practice
                            though exchange of foodstuffs did occur. The notion of growing extra food for sale was a
                            principle introduced by Pākehā.
                            Introducing the Pākehā Economy
                            After the 1830s, Māori were compelled to adapt to Pāhehā ways of food production and
                            exchange, or sale. The practice of an economy based on money was also introduced, although
                            Māori were still able to trade for exchange eg flax for muskets.
                            Many Māori developed huge plantations of potatoes (and other crops) for sale to expanding
                            Pākehā towns. Business was quite brisk, and lucrative. In Waitara, in the 1850s, Te Ātiawa
                            possessed 35 ploughs, 20 pairs of harrows, 40 carts, 300 cattle, 150 horses and a small
                            flotilla of boats. Their produce contributed about $6000 (pounds) to the Taranaki Treasury,
                            even though Pākehā trading vessels were not allowed to call in to Waitara.
                            Māori also took to farming – sheep and cattle raising developed amongst Māori in the Hawkes
                            Bay in particular, but it would not be until the 1870s that people like Rapata Wahawaha
                            would acquire huge flocks of sheep. Renata Kawepo, the old warrior who lost an eye at Battle
                            of Te Porere, also ran 7000 sheep near Hastings.

                            Impacts of War
                            Throughout New Zealand before the wars, then Māori did have some economic success. But the
                            war changed all this.
                            When the British Army marched into Rangiaowhia on 21 February 1864, they approached the
                            village past fields of wheat, maize and potatoes which extended for miles. The Rangiaowhia
                            area, which was called the ‘breadbasket of the Waikato’, was put to the torch, precipitating
                            a near economic collapse amongst the southern Waikato tribes.
                            By wars end, and for decades afterwards, the government acquired huge estates of Māori land,
                            leaving little arable land to many Māori. Farming became highly regulated, placing controls
                            of aspects like fencing and stock importation. A railways and roading infrastructure was
                            developed.
                            Without finance or government development assistance to keep pace with change, Māori farming
                            went into a sharp decline after 1870. Rapidly changing patterns of land ownership impeded
                            Māori efforts to grow their remaining assets. Surveying and legal costs were prohibitive.
                            Access to grain, seeds and transport was increasingly difficult. In 1894, Māori were
                            excluded from a government scheme providing cheap credit to farmers.
                            Rescuing the Māori economy from total ruin would be extremely difficult.

                            Power in the Ancient Times 
                            When Pākehā first arrived in New Zealand, political power resided amongst Māori. Most of the tribes (there were about 50) were large informal groups; real power lay at the level of the hapū, or the sub-tribe.
                            Māori Jurist Eddie Durie has argued that real power, too, was ‘diffuse’ – that is, it was effectively spread throughout the hapū with many different people performing roles that implied a possession of an aspect of real ‘communal’ political power. This was the way that Māori had governed themselves for centuries, and it worked well.
                            Pākehā and Political Power
                            Māori soon realised that European saw the exercise of political power quite differently. However, when the Treaty was signed in 1840, Māori did not realise how different those Pākehā perceptions of political power really were.
                            By signing the Treaty, Māori believed that they were safeguarding the political system they had lived by for generations. But the Crown saw it differently, though this was not made clear to Māori at the time.
                            The Crown view turned on two concepts that were incompatible with Māori views – firstly, that they had acquired sovereignty of New Zealand from Māori, and secondly, that they could thereafter construct an overarching political structure (a Parliament) that would not necessarily reflect Māori political interests, nor even representation.
                            When Hone Heke attacked the British flag at 4 am on 11 March 1845 at Kororareka, he did so because of his disillusionment with the increasing power of the Crown over Māori. The wars that followed came about for identical reasons, especially the war in the Waikato in 1863,  There, a Māori King movement had been established in 1858 to represent the power of Māori as a counterweight to the growing weight of the Crown.  Deeming the Māori King to be unacceptable, the Crown had attacked Waikato in order to destroy the Kingitanga.

                            After the Wars 
                            By 1872, the wars were over, militarily speaking at least. With the Māori King defeated at Rangiriri in 1863 and now in refuge, Māori political power lay in ruins until 1867 when Māori were granted 4 Seats in Parliament. Some Māori saw this as an opportunity to struggle for real power, and a century long search for Māori autonomy began.
