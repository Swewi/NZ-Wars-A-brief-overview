# The New Zealand Wars

![Screenshot of website as a responsive item.](/assets/images/readme/responsiveimage.png)

# Purpose

The idea behind this website is to introduce people to the New Zealand Wars, this is part of history that was barely taught when I was at school.
In an effort to improve the information around this subject the website is designed to deliver core information with external links to more indepth sources.

# UX
### Users

 - As a first time user I want them to be caught by the images, and easy to use layout.
 - As a returning user I want them to actively interact with the external links and investigate further into the site.

I have attempted to make this website as accesable as possible and as adaptable to various screen sizes.

# Structure
### Home Page

The home page is designed to attract attention, I have used a large 'Hero Image' and colour that not only compliment the image but have a relaxing feel.  The Hero Image selected is relavent to the content, as well as possibly drawing people to the site.

The secondary images I used are 'classsic' New Zealand images that people associate with the country. Alonside text that draws attention to the reasons why the site was designed.

### Causes Page

The page is very wordy, by it's nature history often is, I have tried to break it up by using style elements to push bits around the page and added a couple of images, the page retains a logical structure despite the slightly random placing of elements.

I kept order by placing boxes around elements to define them, and draw them together at the same time.

### Campaigns Page

This page acts as a sort of timeline, with a very brief rundown of the individual campaigns, the map image at the top is kept relatively small because it is a poor quality image, however it was the best I could find.  While this page's details are brief there is an extensive 'external links' page with lots of extra sources of info.

### Consequences Page

At the time of writing this, this section is blank, it turns out I over stretched my abilities, however I woild have added sections here about land loss, identy loss, population decline, and the vote, economy.

### External links and Resources Page

This page contains links to useful websites to extend knowledge base, and some useful publications, including a DVD set that remains the only documentary series on this subject ever produced.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

I based my colour scheme around the location and time period of the Wars, I used iColorpalette to find colours that matched my needs, while maintaining a suitable level of contrast for low vision readers.

### Font

Google fonts has a huge range of fonts, for this project I choose two fonts with the 'Sans Serif' fall back.

The font I choose for all the headers was 'Inter' it has a nice smooth look while being blocky enough to resize nicely aacross several header sizes:

The font I choose for all the text was 'Kavivanar', this font was an interesting choice, but it does work, it adds a nice periody,hand writen style to the text:

To highlight the sections within the 'External links and resources Page' I used a number of 'favicons', doing my best to use relavent images, I also used the 'classic' burger icon for the mobile menu drop down.

# Features

### Navigation Bar

I have made the navigation bar as responsive as possible, it is fully interactable at all sizes, in the smallest form the menu operates from a classic 'burger' icon, for screens 768px and larger the menu expands fully into a traditonal 'tab' style.  Each menu page connects with every otehr page.
