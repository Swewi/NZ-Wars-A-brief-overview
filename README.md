# Purpose
The idea behind this website is to introduce people to the New Zealand Wars, this is part of history that was barely taught when I was at school.
In an effort to improve the information around this subject the website is designed to deliver core information with external links to more indepth sources.
# UX
## First time user
 - As a first time user I want them to be caught by the images, and easy to use layout.
 - As a returning user I want them to actively interact with the external links and investigate further into the site.
