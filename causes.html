                <h3>The Land</h3>
                <hr>
                <div id="psuedo-aside-main">
                    <p>
                        Before the arrival of European settlers, Māori possessed distinct patterns of land ownership
                        with
                        'rules' and principles guiding iwi (the tribes) as to how land was to be treated, valued and,
                        above
                        all else, protected.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="psuedo-aside">
                    <p>
                        The arrival of Europeans changed all this, primarily because Māori and Pākehā (white settlers)
                        perceived the importance of the land very differently:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - For Māori, the land was owned communally. Land could be gifted but not be traded
                        permanently
                        for
                        goods or money. Land is the source of tribal history, identity and mana (influence). The
                        land bore
                        the names of ancestors, and the stories of ancient times were personified in landforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - For Pākehā, used to English law, land was owned individually, or by a 'legal entity' eg. a
                        family.
                        Land could also be freely exchanged, it therefore possessed value as a commodity for sale
                        and purchase. Land was improved, cultivated, and used as a physical asset; land
                        'lying idle' was seen as wasteful.
                        Land was the source of social and political position as well as a source of
                        wealth. Owning land as an individual also allowed them the vote, as long as they were male,
                        over 21 years old.

                <h3>European Settlers</h3>
                <hr>
                <div id="psuedo-aside">
                    <p> The First European settlers came from Australia and Britain in the 1790s. The first
                        'British community' was a sealing camp in Doubtful Sound established in 1792 (it survived for
                        two
                        years).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="psuedo-aside-main">
                    <p>
                        The early European settlers were primarily interested in the coastline, hunting for whales
                        and seals. Slowly Europeans moved inland for timber, flax and food, however, access proved
                        difficult, and so these early Pākehā settlers generally established peaceful relations with
                        local
                        Māori communities. With many of them marrying into Māori tribes and became 'Pakeha Maori',
                        living
                        amongst Maori and accepting Maori lore and conventions.

                    <p>
                        Migration ramped up after 1840 when Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and his New Zealand Company,
                        established The Wakefield Settlements, these were modeled on a vision of
                        pre-industrial Britain that had probably never existed. However, it was a concept powerful
                        enough to
                        bring many thousands of British migrants across the world to New Zealand.
                        These new Wakefield settlements were ambitious in their planning, but the entire Wakefield
                        scheme
                        proved impractical, little or no provision was made for Māori.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly, land disputes began to dominate relations between Wakefield and Māori. This was
                        fuelled in part by a deep-seated antagonism between the New Zealand Company and the
                        newly-established Governor, Captain William Hobson. Both groups were struggling for control of
                        New
                        Zealand, and either through design or ignorance, Māori were not seen as a factor in this
                        dispute, a
                        point that was not lost on them.

                <h3>The Treaty of Waitangi</h3>
                <hr>
                <div id="psuedo-aside-main">
                    <p>
                        The Treaty of Waitangi was signed on 6 February 1840, by Captain William Hobson (The first
                        Governor,
                        and Crown representative) and approximately 40 chiefs. Eventually, about 500 chiefs signed one
                        of
                        the half dozen copies that circulated the country.
                        For Māori, the Treaty of Waitangi incorporated several undertakings that the Crown did not
                        fulfil.
                        For example, Maori people were not included when the 'Executive Council to govern New Zealand'
                        was
                        established by Governor Hobson. Māori experienced a gradual but definite imposition of British
                        law
                        and institutions at the expense of traditional Māori law and institutions.

                    <p>
                        Some significant chiefs chose not to sign,
                        especially Te Whero Whero of Waikato, who would later become the first Māori King in 1858.

                        New Zealand no longer belonged to Māori, with space for Pākehā. Instead, New Zealand was now a
                        place
                        for Pākehā, with the Māori squished into the edges. This was contrary to what Māori had thought
                        the
                        Treaty was all about, and they said so.

                        At the same time Ngā Puhi (The tribe around Waitangi and Kororareka -
                        modern day Russel) experienced economic hardship after the Crown took over tax collection for
                        all
                        incoming shipping, and moved the capital from Kororareka to Auckland. This lead to Hone Heke
                        felling
                        of the Maiki Hill flagpole, and the British flag, four times. The fourth time was followed by an
                        attack on Kororareka itself. The town was destroyed and a number of settlers were killed, thus
                        starting the northern war.
